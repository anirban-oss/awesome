I want to make resources about these sites and share them with the world,
so that they can use it and progress faster than myself.

I want to beocme one of the greatest computer scientist of the world
I want to become one of the greatest computer science programmer in the world
I want to learn all about computer science and related subjects intimately and earn a lot of money while doing that
I will get hired at high prices and do awesome jobs for them
I will build my awesome future from fucking rags.

I will get a job at Google SF however much I need to work for that, I dont care, I want to become one of the greatest in the domain of computer science.
I am proud of how much I have worked on myself and grown in the last few years.
